## Purpose
Continuation of writing an OpenGL rendering engine!
Currently developing on Linux and keeping the build-system a bit simpler, which
is why I'm only using a _Makefile_.

- Depth testing
- Stencil testing
- Blending
- Face culling
- Framebuffers
- Cubemaps
- Advanced data
- Advanced GLSL (shader)
- Geometry shading
- Instancing
- Anti-aliasing

## Advanced Lighting Topics
- Advanced lighting
- Gamma correction
- Shadows
- Normal mapping
- Parallax mapping
- HDR
- Bloom
- Deferred shading
- SSAO
